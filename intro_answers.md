# 1. If we were interested in understanding summary statistics at a glance (minimum, maximum, etc.), how could you improve the display of the table?

We could add additional rows to the table at the end and use them to show the statistics, one per row. This does not work as well with long tables. In those cases you may want to add the details at the top, in another table, or in a pop-up when the user hovers over the table.

# 2. Find three varied examples on the web that present tabular data in a different layout or in more visually compelling, complete, interactive or interesting ways.

Here is an example of using color to emphasize the values in the table: http://policeanalyst.com/creating-heat-maps-from-excel-pivot-tables-with-conditional-formatting/

This example shows how using hover and click events to highlight rows can make the table more interactive. It also includes interactive filters, and uses bolding and indentation to show the hierarchy of the data: http://www.eia.gov/oiaf/aeo/tablebrowser/

Finally, this table employs pagination and sorting to show the top relevant results on the screen: http://dataforradicals.com/js/tabletop-to-datatables/
